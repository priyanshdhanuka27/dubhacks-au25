  - Frontend: Nginx-served React app with runtime environment configuration
  - Docker Compose: Full application orchestration with networking and volumes
- **AWS Infrastructure**: 
  - CloudFormation template for complete AWS infrastructure (DynamoDB, OpenSearch, ECS, ALB)
  - Automated deployment scripts with ECR integration
  - Production-ready security groups and IAM roles
- **Database Migration**: Automated DynamoDB table creation and data seeding scripts
- **Environment Management**: Production environment variables and configuration management

#### ✅ 8.3 Write end-to-end integration tests
- **Backend E2E Tests**: Comprehensive integration tests covering complete user workflows
- **Frontend E2E Tests**: React Testing Library tests for UI workflows and user interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Response time validation and concurrent user handling
- **Security Tests**: Authentication, authorization, and input validation testing
- **Error Handling Tests**: Graceful failure scenarios and recovery testing
- **Accessibility Tests**: Keyboard navigation and ARIA compliance verification
